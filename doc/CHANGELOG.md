## [0.1.1a3]
### Changed
- Change dependency to `vak` (<https://github.com/NickleDave/vak>) after
renaming `songdeck` to that--shouldn't affect usage of TweetyNet, but need to 
release new version so dependencies work when installing from PyPI

## [0.1.1a2]
- Version where network is abstracted away from code for benchmarking;
  put that code in a separate library, `songdeck`

## [0.1.1a1]
- Original version uploaded to PyPI
